//make me a function that outputs fizz when it detects a multiple of 3 buzz when a multiple of 5 and fizzbuzz when a multiple of 3 and 5

//lets break it down into a few steps:

//check if its divisible by 3 or 5
//console.log the respective response


//lets break it down further;

//we need to check if its divisible by 3 and 5 first
//print fizzbuzz
//and break out of the loop
//(if we dont check this first it will print the wrong one)

//check if its divisible by 3
//print fizz
//break out of the loop

//check if its divisible by 5
//print buzz
//break out of the loop

//increment our counter(unless we're using a for loop and this is already set up)




function fizzBuzz() {
